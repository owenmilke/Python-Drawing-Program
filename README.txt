# Python Drawing Program

Python Drawing Program is a drawing application similar to Microsoft Paint that allows the user to draw on a canvas using various brush sizes and colors and save their drawings as a .png file.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pygame before operating Python Drawing Program.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

To draw on the canvas simply click and drag the mouse around the canvas.

The toolbar cannot be drawn on.

Clicking on a button will change brush color unless there is a label specifying otherwise.

Saving the drawing will create a .png file which can be found in pdp/drawings/drawing##.png
